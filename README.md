# Motion Magnification: Reveal Subtle Information for Surgical Video!

**Motivation:**

1. Vessel and neurovascular location plays an essential role in endoscopic and robotic surgery.
2. Challenging to avoid inadvertent injury due to limited visual and tactile perception of surgeons.
3. Ultrasound and florescent can be used can be used to detect vessels.
4. But sometimes those are expensive and inconvenient in clinical practice.
5. So recently developed video magnification technique can be used to detect pulsating arteries and veins by amplifying minor pulsation.

**A breif of the exact idea:**

Endoscopic and laparoscopic operations are used for certain minimally invasive procedures, but they restrict the surgeon's visual and haptic input. So, we used motion magnification as an alternate way to detect pulsating arteries and show them directly to the surgeons. In this report, we have shown the implementation of two Eulerian motion magnification methods for surgical videos. Then showed how it is enhancing the hidden motion of pulsating arteries. Besides that, we have performed a couple of performance analysis test for both methods. The above figure shows the graphical representation of our work.
